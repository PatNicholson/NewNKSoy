Project Description: This project is to be submitted in the 2017 INFORMS O.R. & Analytics Student Team Competition. The competition this year is focused on creating a model to predict the sales potential of different soybean varieties for seed biotech company Syngenta. More specifically, the model should be able to predict, among the 'class of 2014' soybean varieties, which varieties to select for commercial release. To accomplish this, our team will be working with data on the sales volume of varieties commercialized in previous years, data from experiments on past 'classes' of soybean varieties, and experiments where varieties from the same families were tested. Once we have created a model using that training data, we will then run that model on 'class of 2014' experiment data to determine which soybean varieties to commercialize.
